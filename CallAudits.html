                        <p>
                            This project is based on work I performed as a Data
                            Analyst working at a high volume call center where
                            there was a drastic need to overhaul the Quality
                            Assurance process. Though the implementation differs
                            slightly, the intent of this project is to showcase
                            core skills used to overcome problems faced by the
                            organization utilizing familiar technologies. The
                            following is a summary with code snippits from this

                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the time, the company was tech-immature and new
                            to even having a dedicated analytics team,
                            spreadsheets and emails served as the core tools
                            underlying most business functions. The call center
                            staffed somewhere around
                            <strong>600 dialers</strong> across
                            <strong>30 teams</strong>, with only
                            <strong>2-3 Quality Assurance agents</strong>
                            responsible for auditing and providing feedback for
                            call volumes in the range of millions per week. A
                            standardized form existed with
                            <strong>pass/fail</strong> categories, where QA
                            would listen to a selection of calls submitted by
                            team leaders and respond via email their findings
                            and follow up with coaching.
                        </p>
                        <p>The core issues I identified in the process are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lack of historical data tracking</li>
                            <li>
                                Indefinite/nonstandard procedure for selecting
                                calls
                            </li>
                            <li>Low coverage due to small sample</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In the process of redefining the auditing procedure,
                            I sought to answer these questions for the business
                            which were not being addressed by the existing
                            process:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who are our highest and lowest performers?</li>
                            <li>What is the impact of quality on our KPI's?</li>
                            <li>
                                Where are our greatest areas of opportunity?
                            </li>
                            <li>How is call quality changing over time?</li>
                            <li>
                                How confident are we in our accuracy of rating
                                quality?
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <hr class="major" />

                        <h2>The Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            The core of the new process was to utilize the tools
                            available to build out an automation which removed
                            the heavy manual burden of call selection and
                            tracking with excel files. In the final iteration,
                            the stack consisted of:

                        <p>
                            The sample repo differs slightly from this
                            implementation but the core workflow is the same: on
                            a weekly basis, a balanced random sample based on
                            business parameters (2 calls that transferred and 2
                            calls where the client hung up per agent from the
                            prior week) was selected, a subset of which was
                            randomly assigned to the QA agents (5 calls of each
                            call end type for each leader). Both groups, leaders
                            and QA agents, would then score their assigned calls
                            based on the existing scorecard categories by a
                            deadline, after which results were recorded into a
                            local database. Finally, a view in the audit
                            database was used for transformations and
                            calculations to be fed into PowerBI and shared with
                            the organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application had to work around limitations,
                            namely that we did not have engineering support or
                            an environment to host and schedule the script. In
                            the end, a single operator orchestrated the loading
                            and generation of audits through a simple CLI and a
                            config file was used to make swappable components
                            (such as creating exemption lists and tracking
                            changes in the QA agent availability if there were
                            to be taken off assingment even if temporarily). In
                            future iterations or an ideal scenario, something
                            like Airflow would enable scheduled jobs and all the
                            data would live in a hosted environment rather than
                            living in local files.
